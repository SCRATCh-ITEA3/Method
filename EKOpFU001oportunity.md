Introduction

## Purpose

This document describes the Stakeholder needs that define the opportunity for
product development of the firmware update system

## Scope

This document identifies needs of stakeholders. A need exists within the
customer/stakeholder, and will be analyzed whether there will be value generated
by addressing the Need, and pursuing the identified opportunities.

## Opportunity Identified

### The Problem

| With the success of the internet of things (IoT), the complexity of software on these devices and hence, their attack surface increases. Furthermore, the most devices are exposed to attacks through networks. Hence, more and more devices are subject to attacks (see [Ripple20](https://www.wired.com/story/ripple20-iot-vulnerabilities)). Therefore, it becomes more and more important to be able to update these devices over the air. It must be ensured that the update mechanism itself does not introduce new vulnerabilities. A remote update involves several steps, including release, deployment, installation, and attestation of the update. Furthermore, a consistent state of software through the whole installed base has to be ensured. A further complication arises from the organizational structure of typical IoT installations including multiple stakeholders: Several *original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)* that are responsible for the IoT devices. Typically they integrate subsystems from various *suppliers*. Then, the network of IoT devices is operated by an *operator* on behalf of the final *user*. | ![](media/5b53307b377916070700da28881f5232.png) |

### Solution proposal (relation: Requirements conceived)

The task of the SCRATCh firmware update system is to deploy data on a given set
of devices. It should handle them automatically so a network of devices can be
maintained properly. The primary focus is firmware but the system can also
handle other types of data. The input of the system is a set of files and a list
of target devices. The system shall ensure that the set of files is distributed
and applied (installed) to the list of target devices. Furthermore, the system
shall provide an attestation that reports the status of the target devices after
the deployment.

### ![](media/085c8a9734d3ca429dde0464dc34f9f3.png)Solution Needed

A firmware update system has to cover the whole software deployment chain from
release up to installation, and attestation. Furthermore, such a system has to
technically support the organizational structures and responsibilities of IoT
supply chains. For example, one OEM is responsible for the software releases of
his device, while the operator has to maintain interoperability between releases
for different devices. A minimal system for firmware update incorporates two
major parts:

1.  The target systems that need to implement a procedure for a secure firmware
    update. Typically, this includes functions to download, install, and boot
    the firmware.
2.  The deployment infrastructure that signs, provides, and distributes firmware
    images.

The interaction of both parts is essential for the security of the system.

We design a firmware update system that addresses this problem. We apply
existing methodologies like [The update
framework](https://theupdateframework.io/) and Uptane, [@uptane_escar] to our
scenarioâ€™s.

Prerequisites

To have a working update firmware system, there must be a basic trust
infrastructure that provide IAM (Identity, Authorization, Management).

Underlying problems (including security issues)

There are multiple frameworks and also different types of bootloaders. Several
have been investigated see Collected research document EKCRFU001. Including
threats and some security requirements.

Specific security requirements can be derived from best practices of ENISA.

Concerning the mayor problems related to security: Authentication,
Identification, Confidentiality, some times collected under the term Trust, the
following ENISA requirements are relevant:
